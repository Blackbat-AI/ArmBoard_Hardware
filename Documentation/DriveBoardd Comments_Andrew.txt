--Schematic--
You need to put a ground flag on the Ground net connected to the andersons so that is connected to the rest of the grounds. 
You need to put a +5V    flag on the +5V    net connected to the AP1509    so that is connected to the rest of the +5V.
AP 1509 wiring is messy and confusing. Consider placing the PowerOut andersons somewhere else
Replace +12V_Act label with +12VA power flag
Rename label "Laser_control" to "Laser_Control"
Rename label "Solenoial_Control" to "Solenoid_Control"
on TIVA,       move all labels out by one grid space and connect to symbol via a short wire
On connectors, move all labels out by one grid space and connect to symbol via a short wire
Replace GND and +5V labels with GND and +5V power flags
On indicators, move all labels and symbols apart by one grid space and connect with a short wire
Indicator label flags have diferent sizes. Make them consistent with the rest of the labels
in indicators, Laser and Solenoid flags need to be "Laser_Control" and "Solenoid_Control"
Add another indicator connected to a +5V power flag
Add text next to each LED to indicate it's color
	Green-Power
	Orange-Actuation (Laser, Solenoid)
	Yellow-Digital Actuation (Serial, Servo PWM)
	Blue-Software Flags
	Red-Software Error Flags
Add the following indicators:
	SW_IND_1 connected to any DIO pin on the tiva
	SW_IND_2 connected to any DIO pin on the tiva
	SW_IND_2 connected to any DIO pin on the tiva
	SW_ERR	 connected to any DIO pin on the tiva
	
--Layout--
Move top and bottom polygons to the edge of the PCB
Add silkscreen to all connectors to indicate what pkugs into them, and what each pins function is. 
Replace AP1509 inductor with the new one (see #arch_electrical)
You have a lot of diagonal traces on your boardmaking a poor use of space. 
	Exibit A- your trace connecting the reset pins has weave between 3 pins to make the trace
Also, you dont need to connect the reset pins of the tiva
+12V_Act trace going to Q1 shuould be a bit thicker. say 20 mil
Throughout your board,you have silkscreen overlapping pads, vias, and other silscreen. Make sure all the references are visible
Your layout is lacking symmetry and consistency overall
AP 1509 culd we wired cleaner. 
Your board needs edge cuts
You have a couple long traces cutting up your ground planes. 
MAX 3232 looks good. 
There are still a few finishing touches we need to do on the silkscreen, but I think you need to fix up some more of the stuff I mentioned here before going on to that. 
Much of these comments would be better explained in person. have another go at layout. Try to focus on keeping everything consistent and symmetrical.
